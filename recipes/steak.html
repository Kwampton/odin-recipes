<p>Steak is an extremely nutritious meal with lots of protein
    and health benefits. I would recommend steak to my worst 
    enemy
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak, fat trimmed</li>
    <li>¾ cup olive oil</li>
    <l1>½ cup light brown sugar</l1>
    <l1>½ cup dry red wine</l1>
    <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons onion powder</li>
    <l1>3 tablespoons honey</l1>
    <l1>3 whole green onions, coarsely chopped</l1>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic vinegar</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground ginger</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Score flank steak by making shallow 
            crisscross cuts on both sides. </li>
        <li>Place olive oil, light brown sugar, 
            red wine, soy sauce, onion powder, honey, green onions, 
            garlic cloves, garlic vinegar, ground ginger, and 
            garlic powder in a blender. Purée until smooth; pour 
            mixture into a resealable plastic bag. Add steak, coat with marinade, 
            squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 
            for 8 hours to overnight. </li>
        <li>Remove steak from the refrigerator and pour marinade into 
            a small saucepan. Allow steak to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring marinade to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low 
            and simmer for 10 minutes; set aside. </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li>Grill the steak on the preheated grill until it starts to firm up and 
            is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 7 minutes per side, 
            basting often with cooked marinade. An instant-read thermometer 
            inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare. </li>
    </ol>


</ul>
